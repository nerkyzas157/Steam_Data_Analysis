# [Project 1: Steam Data Analysis]

In this project I utilized MySQL for data management, dived into gaming trends, user behavior, and more.
In future I will implement gathered data insight to Power BI for dynamic visualizations.

- Data was taken from (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/antonkozyriev/game-recommendations-on-steam/data?select=games.csv).
- Data was cleaned with Microsoft Excel.
- SQL was used for data manipulation.

## File definitions:

- documentation.docx provides a full documentation of how I started and finished the project.
- ERD.drawio shows Entity-Relationship Diagram.
- First_project.sql showcases all the script that was used in this project.
- games.csv is part of the data I used. File lists all games, their reviews and compatibility with platforms.
- recommendations.csv is part of the data I used. Showcases all reviews and their performance.
- users.csv is part of the data I used. It shows user relation to number of products they bought and number of reviews they left.
- Power_BI folder contains background.png and steam_data_analysis_vizualization.pbix. Graphic is used to Power BI background and pbix file showcases analysis in user friendly visuals.

## Completed Features:

- Loaded Steam data into MySQL database.
- Conducted SQL analysis on gaming trends.
